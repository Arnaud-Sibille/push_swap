# push_swap
My 6th 42 project: create a program which order a stack (given as argument) in the less operations possible.

The operations are: push the top of stack A to the top of stack B or the opposite / rotate or reverse-rotate stack A, stack B or both / swap the first two elements of stack A, stack B or both.
